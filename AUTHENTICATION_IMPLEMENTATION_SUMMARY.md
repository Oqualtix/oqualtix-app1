# OQUALTIX AUTHENTICATION & ACCESS CONTROL SYSTEM

## ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive authentication and licensing system for the Oqualtix fraud detection platform with the following key features:

### üîê **License-Based Access Control**
- **Exclusive Access**: Only users with valid license keys from `oqualtix@outlook.com` can access the system
- **Admin Control**: License generation and management restricted to authorized administrators
- **Secure Format**: License keys use format `OQX-[TIMESTAMP]-[RANDOM]-[CHECKSUM]` with built-in validation
- **Expiration**: Automatic license expiration after one year with renewal required

### üë• **Company-Based User Management**
- **One User Per Account**: Each bank account or company card can only have one assigned user
- **Account Assignment**: Users are automatically assigned to available accounts or can request specific ones
- **Company Isolation**: Each license is company-specific with complete data separation
- **Role-Based Access**: Different permission levels (ADMIN, MANAGER, USER) with appropriate controls

### üõ°Ô∏è **Security Features**
- **Session Management**: Secure token-based authentication with 24-hour automatic expiration
- **Permission Control**: Granular permissions for different system functions
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all user actions and system access
- **Access Logging**: Detailed tracking of authentication attempts and license usage

## üìÅ **Files Created/Modified**

### Core Authentication Components
1. **`src/services/LicenseAuthenticationService.js`** - Main license and user management service
2. **`src/middleware/AuthenticationMiddleware.js`** - Authentication middleware for system access
3. **`admin_license_manager.js`** - Administrative interface for license management
4. **`secure_fraud_detection_cli.js`** - Main user interface with authentication integration

### Enhanced Existing Files
- **`src/utils/EnhancedAnomalyDetectionUtils.js`** - Added authentication requirements
- **`package.json`** - Added scripts for authentication testing and admin access

### Documentation & Demo Files
- **`authentication_demo.js`** - Comprehensive demonstration of authentication features
- **`quick_auth_test.js`** - Quick test of core authentication functionality
- **`AUTHENTICATION_SYSTEM_DOCUMENTATION.md`** - Complete documentation

## üîë **How It Works**

### For Companies Requesting Access:
1. **Contact Admin**: Email `oqualtix@outlook.com` with company details
2. **Provide Information**: Include company name, bank accounts, and company cards  
3. **Receive License**: Get unique license key valid for one year
4. **User Assignment**: Each bank account/card gets one assigned user
5. **System Access**: Start using fraud detection with full authentication

### For Daily Operations:
1. **Launch System**: Run `secure_fraud_detection_cli.js`
2. **Authenticate**: Provide license key and user email
3. **Account Assignment**: System assigns user to specific bank account/company card
4. **Access Features**: Use all fraud detection capabilities within assigned scope
5. **Session Management**: 24-hour secure sessions with automatic renewal

### For Administrators:
1. **Admin Authentication**: Use `oqualtix@outlook.com` email and daily auth code
2. **License Management**: Generate new licenses for companies
3. **User Oversight**: Monitor user assignments and system usage
4. **Security Control**: Revoke licenses immediately if needed

## üéØ **Key Features Demonstrated**

### ‚úÖ **License Key Requirements**
- All access requires valid license from `oqualtix@outlook.com`
- Invalid or expired licenses are immediately rejected
- Complete audit trail of all license usage

### ‚úÖ **One User Per Account Restriction** 
- Bank accounts and company cards limited to single user assignment
- Automatic enforcement prevents multiple users on same account
- Clear error messages when limits are exceeded

### ‚úÖ **Role-Based Permissions**
```javascript
// Example permissions by role:
USER: ['view_transactions', 'run_fraud_analysis', 'view_reports']
MANAGER: [...USER, 'manage_company_users', 'export_reports', 'configure_alerts']
ADMIN: [...MANAGER, 'manage_licenses', 'system_configuration', 'delete_data']
```

### ‚úÖ **Secure Session Management**
- Cryptographically secure session tokens
- 24-hour automatic expiration
- Session validation on every system operation

## üöÄ **Usage Examples**

### Command Line Access:
```bash
# Interactive authentication
node secure_fraud_detection_cli.js

# Direct authentication
node secure_fraud_detection_cli.js --license "OQX-ABC123-DEF456-ABCD" --email "user@company.com"

# Admin interface
node admin_license_manager.js
```

### NPM Scripts:
```bash
npm run fraud-detection  # Main fraud detection interface
npm run admin           # Admin license management
npm run auth-test       # Quick authentication test
npm run auth-demo       # Full system demonstration
```

## üîí **Security Compliance**

### Access Control Verification:
- ‚úÖ Only licensed users can access fraud detection features
- ‚úÖ Each company limited to their assigned accounts only
- ‚úÖ One user per bank account/company card enforced
- ‚úÖ Complete audit trail of all access and actions
- ‚úÖ Secure session management with automatic expiration

### Administrative Control:
- ‚úÖ License generation restricted to `oqualtix@outlook.com`
- ‚úÖ Daily rotating authentication codes for admin access
- ‚úÖ Immediate license revocation capability
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive monitoring and reporting

## üìä **System Integration**

The authentication system is fully integrated with all existing fraud detection capabilities:

- **Micro-skimming Detection**: Requires authentication and proper permissions
- **Real-time Monitoring**: User-specific monitoring within assigned accounts
- **Bank Statement Analysis**: Account-scoped analysis with audit logging
- **Notification System**: User and company-specific alert delivery
- **Report Generation**: Permission-based report access with audit trails

## üéâ **Ready for Production**

The authentication system is complete and ready for deployment with:

1. **Full License Management** - Generate, monitor, and revoke licenses
2. **User Assignment Control** - Automatic enforcement of one user per account
3. **Security Compliance** - Complete access control and audit capabilities
4. **Seamless Integration** - Works with all existing fraud detection features
5. **Administrative Interface** - Easy management for `oqualtix@outlook.com`

The system now ensures that only users with valid licenses from `oqualtix@outlook.com` can access the fraud detection capabilities, with each company limited to one user per bank account or company card, exactly as requested!
