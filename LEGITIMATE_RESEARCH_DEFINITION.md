# 🔬 What Constitutes Legitimate Research for Oqualtix Platform

## ✅ **LEGITIMATE RESEARCH ACTIVITIES**

### 1. **Historical Fraud Case Studies**
- **What it is**: Academic and publicly available analysis of documented fraud cases
- **Examples**: 
  - Studying Enron's accounting manipulation techniques (public court records)
  - Analyzing Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme patterns (documented by SEC)
  - Researching Wells Fargo account fraud methods (public investigations)
- **Value**: Understanding patterns helps build detection algorithms
- **Source**: Court documents, SEC filings, academic papers, news reports

### 2. **Algorithm Development Based on Public Data**
- **What it is**: Creating pattern recognition systems based on known fraud indicators
- **Examples**:
  - Micro-skimming detection algorithms based on documented attack patterns
  - Unusual transaction velocity analysis from published research
  - Decimal place manipulation detection from academic studies
- **Value**: Translates research into practical detection tools

### 3. **Synthetic Data Generation**
- **What it is**: Creating realistic but fake transaction data for testing
- **Purpose**: Test algorithms without using real customer data
- **Examples**: 
  - Generating sample transactions with embedded fraud patterns
  - Creating demo scenarios based on known attack vectors
  - Building test cases that simulate real-world fraud situations

### 4. **Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)**
- **What it is**: Analyzing publicly available information about fraud trends
- **Sources**: 
  - FBI fraud reports and statistics
  - Banking industry white papers
  - Academic research on financial crimes
  - Published case studies from fraud investigations
