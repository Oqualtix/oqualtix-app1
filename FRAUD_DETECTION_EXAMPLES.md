# üîç Enhanced Anomaly Detection System - Fraud Detection Examples

## Overview
The Oqualtix Enhanced Anomaly Detection system uses **6 advanced machine learning algorithms** combined with **real AI integration** to detect financial fraud and embezzlement patterns. Here are real-world examples of how it works:

## üß† Detection Algorithms

### 1. **Statistical Outlier Detection** (Z-Score Analysis)
Detects transactions that deviate significantly from normal spending patterns.

**Example Fraud Case:**
```javascript
// Normal employee expense pattern: $50-200 meals
// Fraudulent transaction detected:
{
  amount: -$2,500,
  vendor: "High-End Steakhouse",
  category: "Meals & Entertainment",
  zScore: 4.2, // 4.2 standard deviations above normal
  anomalyType: "STATISTICAL_OUTLIER",
  severity: "HIGH",
  confidence: 95%
}

// Alert Generated:
"üö® FRAUD ALERT: Transaction amount deviates 4.2 standard deviations from normal. 
Employee's typical meal expense: $125, this transaction: $2,500 (1,900% above normal)"
```

### 2. **Behavioral Pattern Recognition**
Analyzes changes in spending behavior over time.

**Example Embezzlement Case:**
```javascript
// Historical Pattern (6 months):
// - Average monthly expenses: $3,200
// - Vendors: 12-15 established suppliers
// - Transaction times: 9 AM - 5 PM weekdays

// Recent Pattern Change (last 30 days):
// - Average monthly expenses: $8,900 (+178%)
// - New vendors: 8 unknown companies
// - Transaction times: Including 11 PM - 6 AM

{
  anomalyType: "BEHAVIORAL_CHANGE",
  changeScore: 0.78, // 78% behavior change
  severity: "HIGH",
  changedPatterns: [
    "SPENDING_VELOCITY_INCREASE",
    "NEW_VENDOR_INTRODUCTION", 
    "UNUSUAL_TIMING_PATTERNS"
  ],
  description: "Significant change in spending behavior - 78% deviation from baseline"
}
```

### 3. **Temporal Analysis** (Time-Based Fraud)
Detects unusual transaction timing patterns.

**Example After-Hours Fraud:**
```javascript
// Fraudulent transactions detected:
[
  {
    amount: -$1,200,
    vendor: "Office Supply Plus",
    date: "2024-10-25T23:45:00", // 11:45 PM
    anomalyType: "TEMPORAL_ANOMALY",
    temporalFlags: ["UNUSUAL_HOUR", "SUSPICIOUS_TIMING"],
    confidence: 85%
  },
  {
    amount: -$800,
    vendor: "Tech Equipment Corp", 
    date: "2024-10-26T02:30:00", // 2:30 AM
    anomalyType: "TEMPORAL_ANOMALY", 
    temporalFlags: ["UNUSUAL_HOUR", "NIGHT_TRANSACTION"],
    confidence: 90%
  }
]

// Pattern Analysis:
"üïê TIMING FRAUD: 15% of transactions occurring outside business hours (normal: 2%).
Multiple large purchases at 11:45 PM and 2:30 AM suggest unauthorized access."
```

### 4. **Network Analysis** (Vendor Relationship Fraud)
Detects suspicious vendor patterns and relationships.

**Example Shell Company Fraud:**
```javascript
// Suspicious vendor network detected:
{
  vendor: "ABC Consulting Services",
  anomalyType: "NEW_VENDOR_LARGE_AMOUNT",
  riskFactors: [
    "NEW_VENDOR", // First appearance 
    "LARGE_AMOUNT", // $15,000 payment
    "NO_PRIOR_RELATIONSHIP",
    "ROUND_NUMBER", // Exactly $15,000.00
    "RAPID_ESCALATION" // From $0 to $15,000 instantly
  ],
  transactions: [
    { amount: -$15000, date: "2024-10-20", description: "Consulting Services" },
    { amount: -$12000, date: "2024-10-22", description: "Professional Services" },
    { amount: -$18000, date: "2024-10-24", description: "Advisory Services" }
  ],
  totalPaid: $45000,
  timeframe: "4 days",
  confidence: 92%
}

// Red Flags Detected:
// ‚úì New vendor with immediate large payments
// ‚úì Vague service descriptions
// ‚úì Round number amounts 
// ‚úì Rapid payment escalation
// ‚úì No competitive bidding evidence
```

### 5. **K-Means Clustering** (Pattern Deviation)
Groups similar transactions and identifies outliers.

**Example Expense Category Fraud:**
```javascript
// Normal "Office Supplies" cluster:
// - Amount range: $50-300
// - Vendors: Staples, Office Depot, Amazon Business
// - Frequency: 2-4 times per month

// Outlier transaction:
{
  amount: -$2,800,
  vendor: "Luxury Electronics Store",
  category: "Office Supplies", // Miscategorized!
  description: "iPad Pro, MacBook accessories",
  anomalyType: "CLUSTERING_OUTLIER",
  clusterFit: 0.15, // Very poor fit (15% similarity)
  severity: "HIGH",
  confidence: 88%
}

// Alert:
"üíª CATEGORY FRAUD: $2,800 'iPad Pro' categorized as 'Office Supplies' 
doesn't match established spending pattern. Similarity to normal office supplies: 15%"
```

### 6. **Cross-Company Benchmarking**
Compares spending against industry standards.

**Example Industry Deviation Fraud:**
```javascript
// Industry Analysis for "Marketing Agencies":
{
  category: "Travel & Entertainment",
  industryAverage: $450, // per transaction
  industryStandardDeviation: $200,
  companyAverage: $1,200, // 167% above industry average
  
  // Suspicious transactions:
  outlierTransactions: [
    {
      amount: -$3,500,
      vendor: "Luxury Resort & Spa",
      description: "Team building retreat",
      industryPercentile: 99.8, // Top 0.2% of industry
      deviationScore: 4.1, // 4.1 standard deviations above industry norm
      anomalyType: "INDUSTRY_DEVIATION"
    }
  ],
  
  analysis: "Company's travel expenses 167% above industry average. 
  This transaction is in the top 0.2% of all marketing agencies."
}
```

## ü§ñ AI Integration Examples

### Neural Network Fraud Detection
```javascript
// TensorFlow.js model prediction:
const fraudProbability = await aiModel.predict([
  transactionAmount,    // $8,500
  vendorRelationship,   // 0.1 (new vendor)
  timePattern,          // 0.2 (unusual time)
  categoryFit,          // 0.3 (poor category match)
  userBehavior,         // 0.8 (major behavior change)
  amountDeviation,      // 3.2 (high deviation)
  frequencyPattern,     // 0.9 (unusual frequency)
  networkAnalysis       // 0.2 (suspicious network)
]);

// Result: 94% fraud probability
{
  aiConfidence: 0.94,
  fraudProbability: 94%,
  recommendation: "IMMEDIATE_INVESTIGATION",
  modelAccuracy: "92% on test data"
}
```

### Natural Language Processing
```javascript
// Transaction description analysis:
const nlpAnalysis = {
  description: "Office supplies and equipment",
  actualVendor: "Luxury Car Dealership",
  nlpFlags: [
    "DESCRIPTION_VENDOR_MISMATCH", // Description doesn't match vendor
    "VAGUE_DESCRIPTION",           // Generic, non-specific terms
