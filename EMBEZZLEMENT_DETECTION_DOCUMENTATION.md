## Detection Methods Based on Real Cases

### 1. **Round Dollar Embezzlement Detection** 
*Inspired by: Dennis Kozlowski - Tyco International*

**Pattern:** Corporate executives using company credit cards for personal expenses, often in round dollar amounts to avoid detailed scrutiny.

**Detection Logic:**
- Identifies transactions in exact thousands or five hundreds ($1,000, $5,000, $10,000, etc.)
- Flags amounts ≥ $1,000 that are perfectly round
- **Risk Score:** 85/100
- **Real Example:** Kozlowski charged $6,000 shower curtain, $15,000 dog umbrella stand to company

**Code Implementation:**
```javascript
// Pattern 1: Round Dollar Amounts (Dennis Kozlowski - Tyco case)
const amount = Math.abs(transaction.amount);
if ((amount % 1000 === 0 || amount % 500 === 0) && amount >= 1000) {
    // Flag as suspicious round dollar embezzlement
}
```

### 2. **Threshold Evasion Embezzlement**
*Inspired by: Wells Fargo Account Fraud Scandal*

**Pattern:** Deliberately keeping transaction amounts just under approval thresholds to avoid additional oversight.

**Detection Logic:**
- Monitors amounts within $100 of common thresholds ($1K, $2.5K, $5K, $10K, $25K, $50K)
- Identifies systematic avoidance of approval limits
- **Risk Score:** 90/100
- **Real Example:** Wells Fargo employees created fake accounts to avoid performance scrutiny

**Thresholds Monitored:**
- $999 (just under $1,000 approval limit)
- $2,499 (just under $2,500 manager approval)
- $4,999 (just under $5,000 department head approval)
- $9,999 (just under $10,000 executive approval)
- $24,999 (just under $25,000 board approval)

---

### 3. **Structuring Embezzlement Detection**
*Inspired by: Rita Crundwell - Dixon, Illinois*

**Pattern:** Many small transactions over extended periods that total large amounts, designed to avoid detection through volume limits.

**Detection Logic:**
- Identifies vendors with 15+ transactions under $5,000
- Calculates total amounts exceeding $50,000
- Flags when average transaction is under $3,000
- **Risk Score:** 95/100
- **Real Example:** Crundwell stole $53.7M over 22 years through 179 small fraudulent transfers

**Statistical Indicators:**
- Transaction count: ≥15 small payments
- Total amount: >$50,000
- Average payment: <$3,000
- Time period: Extended duration

---

### 4. **Duplicate Vendor Embezzlement**
*Inspired by: Frank Abagnale Techniques*

**Pattern:** Creating multiple vendor identities with slightly different names to hide the concentration of payments to a single fraudulent entity.

**Detection Logic:**
- Compares all vendor names using string similarity algorithms
- Flags vendors with >75% name similarity but <100% (not exact duplicates)
- **Risk Score:** 80/100
- **Real Example:** "ABC Consulting Services" vs "ABC Consulting Service" vs "A.B.C. Consulting Services"

**Similarity Detection:**
```javascript
const similarity = calculateStringSimilarity(vendor1, vendor2);
if (similarity > 0.75 && similarity < 1.0) {
    // Flag as potentially duplicate vendor
}
```

---

### 5. **Off-Hours Embezzlement Detection**
*Inspired by: Enron Energy Trading Manipulation*

**Pattern:** Large transactions during weekends, holidays, or after-hours when oversight and supervision are minimal.

**Detection Logic:**
- Flags transactions >$10,000 during:
  - Weekends (Saturday/Sunday)
  - Federal holidays
  - After hours (before 6 AM or after 10 PM)
- **Risk Score:** 85/100
- **Real Example:** Enron traders manipulated energy markets during off-peak oversight hours

**Timing Risk Factors:**
- Weekend transactions
- Holiday processing
- Late night/early morning activity
- Minimal supervision periods

---

### 6. **Excessive Expense Embezzlement**
*Inspired by: Scott London - KPMG Insider Trading*

**Pattern:** Unusual patterns in employee expense reimbursements, particularly high-frequency, high-value expense claims.

**Detection Logic:**
- Analyzes expense categories (travel, meals, entertainment, supplies)
- Flags employees with >20 expenses and average >$500
- **Risk Score:** 65/100
- **Real Example:** London received cash and gifts for insider information on KPMG audit clients

## Advanced Scheme Detection

### 7. **Ponzi Scheme Pattern Detection**
*Inspired by: Bernie Madoff Investment Scandal*

**Pattern:** Unusually consistent returns that are mathematically improbable, funded by new investor money.

**Detection Logic:**
- Analyzes return payment consistency (low coefficient of variation)
- Compares outgoing returns vs. incoming investments
- **Risk Score:** 95/100 (Critical)
- **Real Example:** Madoff's returns showed suspiciously low volatility over decades

**Mathematical Indicators:**
- Coefficient of variation <0.1 (too consistent)
- Returns exceed new investments by >20%
- Perfect consistency in volatile markets

---

### 8. **Shell Company Detection**
*Inspired by: Enron Special Purpose Entities (SPEs)*

**Pattern:** Vendors that lack business diversity, have minimal transaction history, or show other characteristics of shell companies.

**Detection Logic:**
- High-value, low-frequency transactions
- Single category transactions with high values
- Repetitive transaction descriptions
- New vendors with immediate large transactions
- **Risk Score:** Variable (20-100 based on flags)

**Shell Company Indicators:**
- >$100K total with <5 transactions
- Single business category with >$50K
- Repetitive descriptions across transactions
- New vendor (<30 days) with >$25K

---

### 9. **Kickback Scheme Detection**
*Inspired by: Siemens Bribery Scandal*

**Pattern:** Consulting or advisory payments that follow large contract awards, particularly with round percentage amounts.

**Detection Logic:**
- Identifies consulting payments within 30 days of large contracts
- Flags round amounts typical of percentage-based kickbacks
- Analyzes high-value, low-volume consulting patterns
- **Risk Score:** 90-95/100
- **Real Example:** Siemens paid $1.6B in bribes worldwide through consulting arrangements

**Kickback Indicators:**
- Consulting payment after contract award
- Round percentage amounts ($250, $500, $1K multiples)
- High consulting fees with low transaction volume
- Unusual timing correlations
