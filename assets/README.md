# Asset files would go here
# For development, you can use placeholder images or Expo's default assets
# The following files are referenced in app.json:
# - icon.png (app icon)
# - splash.png (splash screen)
# - adaptive-icon.png (Android adaptive icon)
# - favicon.png (web favicon)

# You can generate these assets using Expo's asset generation tools
# or create your own custom assets
